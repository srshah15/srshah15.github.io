Description:

Start: The program begins execution.

Generate Random Number: A random number is selected between 1 and 100. This will be the target the user tries to guess.

User Prompt: The user is asked to enter their guess.

Input Validation: The program checks if the userâ€™s input is a valid number:

If not a number, the user is shown an error and asked to try again.
If a valid number, proceed to checking the guess.

Guess Evaluation:

If the guess is equal to the target number, display a "Correct!" message and end the program.
If the guess is greater than the target, display "Too high".
If the guess is less than the target, display "Too low".

Repeat Guessing Loop: If the guess is incorrect, the user is re-prompted to guess again. The loop continues until the correct number is guessed.

End: The game concludes once the correct number has been guessed.
