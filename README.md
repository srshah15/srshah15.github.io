# About Me

## My Interests

Hi there! I'm enjoy exploring the intersections of technology, creativity, and problem-solving. I'm particularly interested in software development and how tools can be built to improve everyday life. Whether it's learning a new programming language or building something small but useful, I enjoy being hands-on with tech.

Outside of programming, I like reading nonfiction, watching documentaries, and playing strategy games. I’m also really into keeping up with current events and how technology is shaping our world.

## Websites I Recommend

- [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com) – A fantastic place to keep up with tech news, thoughtful discussions, and insights from developers, founders, and curious minds.

- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com) – There's a subreddit for just about everything. I use it to follow programming discussions, news, and niche hobbies. It’s a great way to learn from different perspectives.

- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com) – Whether it's coding tutorials, tech reviews, or just relaxing content, YouTube has been a huge part of how I learn and unwind.
